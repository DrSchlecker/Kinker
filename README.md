          1. Landingpage: loosk good, Mode 1 & Mode2 Button working
          2. Mode1: Entering Names works, In game layout shows player Names and whos turn it is. Matching cards does not work (Q1 yes & Q3 yes = Q2 match e.g.); different player                 names have same game save, as previous players. Back Home works.
          3. Mode2: Join Session/ Create session via Player Names layout is good. Create session works, but does not recognize when player joined. Joining session looks like it                  works, but does not, is like Mode 1, one device answers for both players. Also Questions do not work similar to Mode1 Problem. When Join Session, the joins ession                   layout still shows ingame (hide.element join-session e.g.) 
          4. back Home button: When session created also at landing page create session layout shown
